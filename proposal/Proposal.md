### Tentative Project Title

Exploring the COVID-19 Risks and Trends in the State of California

### Motivation

COVID-19 has resulted in many long-term effects on societies all across
the world, especially in areas with high population density such as the
State of California. The motivation of our project is to investigate the
trends of COVID-19 new cases development in the past in relation with
factors like vaccine administration and demographic factors. We aim to
eventually come up with conclusions that can identify vulnerable groups
and areas to COVID-19 and offer suggestions for the protection of people
against the disease.

### Intended Final Products

A website showing our analysis and discussion on the subject of
interest, with panels including dashboards that present visualizations
of the relationship between the disease and different categories.

### Anticipated Data Sources

We planned to extract the raw data on COVID-19 case surveillance from
the public use COVID data tracker of the Centers for [California Health
and Human Service Open Data
Portal](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/organization/california-department-of-public-health).

Two exemplary data sets that we intend to use are given below:

<https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-time-series-metrics-by-county-and-state>
: This data set focuses at information such as demographic category,
total cases, case percentage, death, and report date related to COVID-19
in different counties of the state of California.

<https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-post-vaccination-infection-data>
: This data set focuses on the COVID-19 disease information on
vaccination status, including variables such as vaccinated cases
vs. unvaccinated cases, vaccinated death vs. unvaccinated death.

### Planned Analyses/Visualizations/Coding Challenges

We intend to perform a four-stage analysis as follows. 1. Data
pre-processing - Data source - Data cleaning 2. Exploratory analysis -
Outcome by the demographics - Age, gender, race/ethnicity, - Outcome by
the geography - States, Cities, Borough, PUMAs - Outcome over time -
Association between predictors and outcomes 3. Statistical analysis -
Methodology - Results - Diagnostics 4. Additional prediction - Risk
analysis - Correlation regression

### Planned Timeline

-   11/19-11/24: Dataset Merge and Cleaning
-   11/24-11/29: Exploratory Analysis
-   11/29-12/4: Statistical analysis (regression, modeling, graph
    plotting)
-   12/4-12/8: Construct report and generate webpage/screencast
-   12/8-12/11: Finishing touches
-   12/10: Report/Webpage due
-   12/15: “In-class” discussion of projects
