<p>The plots above show the <span class="math inline">\(C_p\)</span>
index and Adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> for various
numbers of parameters. When choosing a model based on <span
class="math inline">\(C_p\)</span> criterion, we want to choose a model
for which <span class="math inline">\(C_p \leq p\)</span>, where p is
the number of parameters. From the <span
class="math inline">\(C_p\)</span> plot above, we should have either 4
parameters (3 predictors), 5 parameters (4 predictors), or 6 parameters
(5 predictors). If we consider the principle of parsimony as well, this
would suggest the 4 parameters (3 predictors) model. But if we choose
the model with 5 parameters (4 predictors), which has the lowest value
for <span class="math inline">\(C_p\)</span></p>

<li>As the interaction term has p-value &lt; 0.05, we can conclude that
ln(population) and ln(total_tests) have significant interaction at 0.05
significance level, hence the two variables will be included in the
model with the interaction term.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these methods agree on the same suggested model. This
might give good evidence that we should explore this model further.</p>
<p>From the outputs above, we see that frost had a p-value close to
0.05. This might mean that the relationship between life expectancy and
frost is weak. To determine if there is an association between
illiteracy and HS graduation rate, we can refer to our matrix of plots
in part a. The correlation between these two variables is quite strong
(approx. 0.7), implying that including that including both of these
variables in the model could result in poor coefficient estimation and
inflated standard errors (due to multicollinearity). Our model selection
techniques were able to “figure this out” and only HS gradation rate was
included in the final models.</p>

<li>From the output above, the overall RMSE (root mean squared error) is
0.081, which would mean our MSE is 0.007. Our MAE (mean absolute error)
is 0.066. These measures show that this model is doing a good job at
predicting responses for “new” data points. Additionally, the variance
for these measures is relatively small, showing that these estimates are
probably pretty close to the true predictive ability.</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>We employed automatic search procedures, criterion based approaches,
and the LASSO technique to select a final model with the outcome of
death rate and totally 7 parameters:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{DR}=-0.572+0.079 \cdot
lnI(location=inland)+0.002 \cdot vacci-0.004 \cdot labor+0.066 \cdot
ln(test)+0.034 \cdot ln(area)+0.073 \cdot ln(unemploy)\]</span> where
“DR” is death rate (fatality), “vacci” indicates the vaccination
situation, and “unemploy’ accounts for unemployment rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>From this model, we can see that as the murder rate and average
number of freezing days (frost) increase, the predicted life expectancy
decreases, while increases in high school graduations and (log)
population were associated with an increase in expected life expectancy.
Overall, from our 10-fold cross validation, we see that our model has
pretty good predictive ability for new points. However, this model was
only built on data from the US, so it should not be used to predict life
expectancy in other locations. Additionally, we noticed that Hawaii was
a potential influential point – by exploring Hawaii’s role in our model,
we may have slightly different conclusions.</li>
