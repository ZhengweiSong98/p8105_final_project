<p>On this page, we’ll explore overall trends for our key outcomes –
COVID <code>prevalence</code> and COVID <code>death rate</code> – across
counties in California, as well as the high-level trends for how these
outcomes correlate with census predictors, including major demographic
variables such as age, gender, and race, and other independent
variables, such as unemployment rate, hospitalization percentage,
vaccination rate, and land areas.[TBD***]</p>
<div id="outcomes-by-county" class="section level1">
<h1>1. Outcomes by county</h1>
<div id="a.-prevalence-across-county" class="section level2">
<h2>1a. Prevalence across county</h2>
<p>Considering the different population bases for each county, we
decided to convert the values in the <code>total case count</code> into
the <code>prevalence</code> proportion. Prevalence is defined as the
proportion of persons in a population who have a particular disease or
attribute at a specified point in time or over a specified period of
time. By utilizing <code>prevalence</code>, we are able to conduct a
more comparable analysis of their respective pandemic responses across
counties.</p>

<p>Until November 2022 (information given by data source), we can
observe that the COVID prevalence ranges from as low as 0.094 to nearly
0.386 by county in California, suggesting a roughly 4.1x difference
between the minimum and maximum. As a new study from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed, the percentage of
Americans who have been infected with COVID-19 is approximately 30% in
November 2022. Taking the prevalence of 30% as the baseline for further
comparisons, it is worth noticing that around 80% of counties in
California have a moderate level of prevalence falling between around
16% to 29%, and around 10% of counties show a quite low prevalence below
15%. Only 6 out of 58 counties in California shows prevalence of above
30%. The COVID infection in California seems relatively controllable to
a large extent compared to the general prevalence level across the
United States. As for the prevalence differences, it may be caused by
some other differentiable factors across counties, and we would like to
further discuss about it in later parts.</p>

<h2>1b. Death rate across county</h2>
<p>The death rate, or called case-fatality ratio, is defined as the
ratio of deaths to the population of a particular area or during a
particular period of time. Analyzing death rate help us track the social
economical and geographical characteristics of those dying due to COVID
in California, and allow comparisons of death trends across
counties.</p>

<p>We can observe that the death rates range from as low as 0.00% to
1.76% by county in California. The density graph suggests a quite
centralized distribution of death rates across counties, that most
counties’ death rates fall between 0.25% to 1.25%. As for the minimum
value from this data set, there is so far no recorded death so as 0%
death rate in Alpine. As for the maximum, Siskiyou’s recorded death rate
is 1.76% in November 2022, which is a little bit higher than the average
country-wide death rate of 1.09% (data reported by <a
href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">John Hopkins
University’s Coronavirus Resource Center</a>). Considering the
difference shown in death rates across counties, we will investigate the
associations between this outcome variable and other potential factors
in the following section.</p>

<p>From the above tables and bar charts, Kings County responses to COVID
with highest prevalence of 38.64%, and Siskiyou responses to covid with
highest death rate of 1.76%. In comparison, Modoc has the lowest
prevalence of 9.45% in California, and Alpine has no recorded death
until November 2022. Upon observations, two out of ten counties with top
prevalence, Imperial and Tuolumne, also have top death rates. And two
out of ten counties with lowest prevalence, Alpine and Colusa, also have
lowest death rates. While to be highlighted here, Siskiyou County has
one of the lowest prevalence but the highest death rate among all
counties. This preliminary observation indicates that it is hard to
obtain an apparent relationship between the prevalence and death rates.
Further steps are required to take in order to explore the associations
and correlations between our two outcome variables, COVID prevalence and
death rates.</p>

<p>The points fall quite randomly on the plot, which indicates that
there is no obvious or strong relationship between the outcome
variables. Moreover, the correlation coefficient can range in value from
−1 to +1. The larger the absolute value of the coefficient, the stronger
the relationship between the variables. In our case, the correlation
coefficient of -0.086 means that the relationship between outcomes are
very weak and it is not statistically significant at all. Before this
procedure, we made a reasonable guess that as prevalence increases, the
death rates may increase. However, this plot result contradicts our
hypothesis by showing a negative correlation in nature. Hence, in order
to gather more comprehensive evidence on this relationship, we decide to
take population by county into consideration for a further test on the
association between outcomes.</p>

<h1>4. Associations between outcomes across county</h1>
<p>To find out the associations between two outcomes across counties, we
decide to use bubble chart to visualize relationships between three
numeric variables, death rates, prevalence proportion, and the
population size for each county.</p>

<p>As we plotted, the values for each bubble are encoded by its
horizontal position on the x-axis of prevalence, its vertical position
on the y-axis of death rates, and the size of the bubble depends on the
population size. The color of each bubble represent different counties
in California to provide a visual sense.</p>
<p>On one hand, there is a positive best-fit trend line drawn on this
plot which indicates a positive relationship between prevalence and
death rates across counties, although this relationship is considerably
weak. On the other hand, as the values on the horizontal and vertical
scale decreases, we can only observe small bubbles on the bottom-left
corners. And as the values on the horizontal or vertical scale
increases, relatively large bubbles start to appear. To add on, the
largest bubble of Los Angeles located on the top-right corner on this
graph, indicating its relatively high prevalence and high death rate.
These two perspective of findings may coincide with each other,
suggesting a positive but weak relationship between outcomes across
county.</p>
<p>Combining our findings in part 3 and 4, we can primarily conclude
that across counties in California, <code>prevalence</code> and
<code>death rate</code> are very weakly correlated.</p>
