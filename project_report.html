<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div id="motivation" class="section level4">
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>With the spread of COVID-19 enters its third year, the human society
seem to have accepted its existence and accepted it as part of our daily
lives. However, that doesn’t mean COVID has stopped its harm on the
public. with the huge amount of studies on COVID-19 in multiple
different disciplines of studies, researchers and scholars have
understand its influence more than ever, and agreed on the fact that
COVID has disproportionately harmed certain groups of people more than
others due to <a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1851382">race,
economic, or social status.</a></p>
<p>With interest in investigating more on factors that can influence
people’s chances of getting the disease, the builders of this website
decided to look specifically into one state of America: California.
California is chosen due to its large geographic area, relatively large
population size, and relatively modern infrastructures. It is likely
that California’s picture during the pandemic can be interpreted as a
reference to other regions with high population across the world. Since
COVID-19 is a highly transmissible disease to start with, this is ideal
knowledge that analysts want to gain insight on.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level4">
<h4>Related Work</h4>
<p>As stated in motivation, there are many published works focused on
COVID since its first outbreak. To gain as much insight on the Initial
questions as possible, the analysts mainly looked at literature related
to COVID spreading in the region of California.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598">A
particular paper</a> was very valuable to this investigation as it
analyzed more than a thousand cases of COVID-19 patients in California
during a time period that overlaps partly with our time period of
investigation interest.It used multivariable logistic regression to
assess the risk of hospitalization for the patients, which is also a
regression method that this investigation intend to use. Thus, it was a
very good reference literature.</p>
<p>Since part of the data set that this study is based on are focused on
different age groups and their chance of hospitalization and infection
of COVID-19. One of the key factors that analysts are interested in is
age. To understand this particular sector better, <a
href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abe8372">this
piece of literature</a> provided lots of information on the “source age
group” of resurgence of cases during the pandemic, and offered insights
on potential confonders that needs to be mentioned and discussed in this
investigation.</p>
<p>Apart from populations that gets the disease, it is also necessary to
discuss the most popular measure for public to avoid getting the disease
in the first place: vaccination. There are lots of published papers,
articles, and <a
href="https://www.gavi.org/covid19-vaccines?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkMGcBhCSARIsAIW6d0BUi9lbMMWwoJ7FTmCexEJBhB4GvVsFFIvKkecWwx0-56lMKlHI0wUaApzqEALw_wcB">websites</a>
informing public the effect and basic knowledge about the vaccine.
However, there are still groups of people who doesn’t take the vaccine
due to many different reasons such as religion, personal beliefs,
economic difficulties or hardship of getting access to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Through analyzing extracted dataset, it is the hope of this
investigation to find certain populations that are least likely to take
the vaccine and propose potential future works to find out what caused
the observed pattern. To better understand the process, analysts looked
at <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm?fbclid=IwAR0V9HbHoK8TZNZd5PptJoahzzS2qpwVCGAztIvAZzNNdPLweSaPWCYPnGU">a
paper published on CDC official website</a> to gain valuable insights.It
is mentioned in this work that the least vaccined group keeps changing
as time pass by. suggesting that timeliness is something that should be
considered in later discussion.</p>
<p><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/">The COVID website</a> created by
the government of California is also a big inspiration in the creation
process of this website, as builders designed part of the planning of
this website while referring to it.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level4">
<h4>Initial questions</h4>
<p>Our initial questions is how does different factors(e.g. Race, Age,
Demographic factor, gender) influence on the hospitalization and disease
odds for an individual or social group in the state of California.
Particularly, does different sex groups have difference in their
vaccination rate? In what parts of California tend to have the highest
prevalence of the disease? How does the hospitalization rate differs
among each racial group? Are teenagers being considered as a vulnerable
group towards the virus, judging based on the data set we have?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<div id="chhs" class="section level4">
<h4>CHHS</h4>
<p>A major part of the data used in this investigation originally came
from <a
href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/organization/california-department-of-public-health">California
Health and Human Service Open Data Portal</a>. This is a website with
numerous databases, directly held by the agency of California health and
human services, abbreviated as CHHS. California health and human service
is the state agency tasked with administration and oversight of “state
and federal programs for health care, social services, public assistance
and rehabilitation” in the U.S. state of California. The agency is
headed by the Secretary of the California Health and Human Services
Agency, with headquarters in Sacramento. Many of the laws in the
California Health and Safety Codes are enforced by it.</p>
<p>This data portal includes data related to public health activities
across the state of California. Most of which is collected at the county
level but there are also data sets that contains data at individual
level.</p>
<p>The three specific datasets that will be used for this investigation
later is listed below, extracted from the site by simply downloading
them into the R project:</p>
<p><a
href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-time-series-metrics-by-county-and-state">First
data set</a> : This data set focuses at information such as demographic
category, total cases, case percentage, death, and report date related
to COVID-19 in different counties of the state of California.</p>
<p><a
href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-post-vaccination-infection-data">Second
data set</a> : This data set focuses on the COVID-19 disease information
on vaccination status, including variables such as vaccinated cases
vs. unvaccinated cases, vaccinated death vs. unvaccinated death.</p>
<p><a
href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-hospital-data">Third
data set</a>: This data set is focused on the hospitalization by county
in California. Besides recording the amount of people that are
hospitalized, it offers comparison between the hospitalized COVID
confirmed patients, and ICU suspected covid patients in the region.</p>
</div>
<div id="opendatasoft" class="section level4">
<h4>Opendatasoft</h4>
<p>In order to present an interactive map to users that contains
population infected by time in different counties, analysts referred to
geographic coordination data online for each county.</p>
<p>Opendatasoft is a French company that offers data sharing software.
Based in Paris, it also has a subsidiary in Boston (United States) and
an office in Nantes(France). Opendatasoft has developed a tool for
sharing and reusing the data of companies and public administrations.
Its software lets people organize, share, and visualize any type of
data. The software can be used by both private companies and public
entities. The <a

<div id="employment-development-department" class="section level4">
<h4>Employment Development Department</h4>
<p>Since 1935, the Employment Development Department(EDD) had been
connecting with job seekers and employers in an effort to build the
economy of Golden State. Mean while it has been collecting data related
to employment each month by industry data for California and sub-state
areas. One of its data set is <a
href="https://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/industry-employment-and-unemployment-rates-for-counties.html">current
industry employment and unemployment rates for counties</a>, which could
produce insightful result through this investigation by connecting data
like unemployment rate to the prevalence of disease or hospitalization
rate. A The data cleaning process is being presented in the index page,

<div id="inference-analysis-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Inference Analysis: Regression</h3>
<div id="multiple-linear-regression" class="section level4">
<h4>Multiple linear Regression</h4>
<p>For model building purpose of this investigation, a multiple linear
regression model is considered to investigate on hospitalization rate.
The underlying logic for this model is relatively simple, analysts
extract data that includes disease prevalence, area, population,
location and tests. The hypothetical multiple linear regression function
for this particular inference analysis is shown as below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{Prevalence}=-69.049+9.251 \cdot
ln(unemployment)+1.495 \cdot ln(area)+0.642 \cdot ln(population)+9.389
\cdot ln(test)\]</span></p>
<p>In the above equation, disease prevalence is the desired outcome
while the amount of tests, unemployment, area, location, and population
are predictors. B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5 are the factors for each
predictors respectively. Under ideal circumstances, we would expect our
model to be able to predict the death counts in a region, given its
number of tests, population, and unemployment rate.</p>
<p>It is necessary to mention that in the original dataset on which this
model looked at, analysts observed strong correlation within the some
other data variables such as <code>vaccination</code> and
<code>labor_rate</code>. After some data exploratory works, some
right-skewness is noticed so analysts decided to apply natural
logarithms to each continuous variables.</p>
<p>Another thing to look at was the correlation between the predictors
to avoid the potential effect of multicollinearity, which is a
statistical concept that describes the incidence of several independent
variables in a model are in fact correlated within themselves. This
correlation test is later combined with criterion based model selection
to select which predictors to put in for the final model.</p>
<p>The three criterion based model selection method are Cp criterion,
adjusted R squared criterion, and LASSO. The results of these model
selection method all gave similar predictor size, so in the end the
analysts chose four predictors to construct the final model as shown in
the equation above. After the construction of this model, a corss
validation process is performed to further assess the prediction ability
of this model.</p>
</div>

<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<div id="project-obstacle" class="section level4">
<h4>Project Obstacle</h4>
<p>One of the first obstacles this project met was related with data
scraping and cleaning. It was the groups’ intention to perform similar
investigations about COVID, but on a much more broader scale such as
across the whole country. The reason that analysts didn’t follow this
starting plan is because data sets from different parts of the country
simply are organized quite differently. So it would take analysts a lot
of time to do the necessary bindings to forge a complete data set to
work on. Also it is questioned whether the equipment that analysts use
can efficiently process such large amount of data in reasonable time
during later analysis process.</p>
<p>After deciding to put our focus on the state of California, the next
obstacle analysts met was related to data pre-processing. There were
lots of data variables retrieved from the original database that aren’t
going to be used in this investigation and also certain variable columns
need to be created using the <code>mutate</code> function. As team
members excahnged a lot of ideas when discussing and planning on which
specific data to throw out and which ones to keep, sometimes there were
even data manipulations going “back and forth”, the website building
process didn’t really start for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Formulating the right regression model and choosing the right
variables to draw graphs were challenges as well. Due to lots of
multicolinearity in our original data set, analysts had to run multiple
model selection to decide which variables to include in the final model.
A larger issue was that some originally designed plotting turned out to
be just not feasible due to errors from the data set, for example in
some cases, the death rate of a county was 100%, which is clearly wrong.
It was also a challenge overall to interpret correlations after the
model is built and summarization of the model given using code because
most of the correlations aren’t perfect, there could be confounders that
we haven’t considered in the model.</p>

<p>This investigations finding started off from exploratory analysis,
where we first looked at the prevalence across counties. Until November
2022, COVID prevalence in California ranges from 0.094 to 0.386, with
the lowest being the county of Modoc and highest being the county of
Kings. Majority of the regions had experienced a prevalence between 0.15
to 0.25.</p>
<p>Another parameter we looked at was the death rate across different
counties. The county with the lowest death rate in California was
Alpine, where the death rate was 0 while the county with the highest
death rate was Siskiyou, at about 1.76%. The majority death rate across
counties fall within the bound of 0.25% to 1.25%.</p>
<p>We further looked at the correlation between prevalence and death
rates. It is interesting for us to notice that the correlation between
these two factors was very low, with a correlation factor of -0.086.
Meaning that in general, the disease prevalence in a county doesn’t
affect the death rate in that county. This is quite counter intuitive as
logically, higher disease prevalence means more pressure on the health
care system of that county, which is likely to lead to higher death rate
as patients not being able to get the medical attention they need.</p>
<p>One possible explanation that we would offer for observing this
phenomenon is that places with high disease prevalence may also tend to
be places with high population density and better medical system. Thus
although the prevalence is high, those counties are still able to
control their death rate.</p>
<p>To examine our guess, we decide to take population by county into
consideration for a further test on the association between outcomes.
The finding of this test shows a relatively weak, but positive
relationship between prevalence and death rates. So we still conclude
that prevalence and death rate are very weakly correlated.</p>
<p>To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship
between the categorical groups that we considered to put in for our
prediction model. Two ANOVA tests were run, one focusing on the
predictors for fatality and the other one focusing on prevalence. The
ANOVA test for fatality shows that only the variable
<code>vaccinated</code> isn’t significant as a predictor. We consider
this finding as suggesting that vaccination, although certainly can help
prevent someone from getting COVID, can’t affect an individual’s chance
of dying from COVID.</p>
<p>The ANOVA test for disease prevalence shows that location is the only
predictor that is not significant, which is understandable as the
location of a county shouldn’t be linked to its ability on treating the
COVID patients.</p>
<p>For the two MLR models constructed in our Inference Analysis session,
we first claim the disease prevalence in each county is a linear
combination of four predictor variables, we found unemployment, area of
the county, population and amount of tests all positively associated
with disease prevalence.</p>
<p>For the second model, we claim death rate in each county is a linear
combination of seven predictor variables. The death rate is positively
correlated with whether the county being an inland county, vaccination
situation, unemployment rate, area of the county, amount of tests while
being negatively correlated with the proportion of labor forces in the
population.</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<p>After looking back on our investigation, we would suggested future
research to try to understand more on the association between
socioeconomic factors and COVID prevalence/death rate. According to our
models, although vaccine definitely has its value in disease control, it
doesn’t seem to stand out among all the other variables such as
unemployment and proportion of labor forces in the population.
Researches should also be done to investigate on how to better protect
the non-labor force population, which tends to be our elders in the
society since our investigation suggests that lower labor proportion
population has higher death rate from COVID.</p>
