## P8105ï¼šProject Report

### Introduction
#### Motivation
With the spread of COVID-19 enters its third year, the human society seem to have accepted its existence and accepted it as part of our daily lives. However, that doesn't mean COVID has stopped its harm on the public. with the huge amount of studies on COVID-19 in multiple different disciplines of studies, researchers and scholars have understand its influence more than ever, and agreed on the fact that COVID has disproportionately harmed certain groups of people more than others due to [race, economic, or social status.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1851382)

With interest in investigating more on factors that can influence people's chances of getting the disease, the builders of this website decided to look specifically into one state of America: California. California is chosen due to its large geographic area, relatively large population size, and relatively modern infrastructures. It is likely that California's picture during the pandemic can be interpreted as a reference to other regions with high population across the world. Since COVID-19 is a highly transmissible disease to start with, this is ideal knowledge that analysts want to gain insight on.

#### Related Work
As stated in motivation, there are many published works focused on COVID since its first outbreak. To gain as much insight on the Initial questions as possible, the analysts mainly looked at literature related to COVID spreading in the region of California. 

[A particular paper](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598) was very valuable to this investigation as it analyzed more than a thousand cases of COVID-19 patients in California during a time period that overlaps partly with our time period of investigation interest.It used multivariable logistic regression to assess the risk of hospitalization for the patients, which is also a regression method that this investigation intend to use. Thus, it was a very good reference literature.

Since part of the data set that this study is based on are focused on different age groups and their chance of hospitalization and infection of COVID-19. One of the key factors that analysts are interested in is age.
To understand this particular sector better, [this piece of literature](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abe8372) provided lots of information on the "source age group" of resurgence of cases during the pandemic, and offered insights on potential confonders that needs to be mentioned and discussed in this investigation. 

Apart from populations that gets the disease, it is also necessary to discuss the most popular measure for public to avoid getting the disease in the first place: vaccination. There are lots of published papers, articles, and [websites](https://www.gavi.org/covid19-vaccines?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkMGcBhCSARIsAIW6d0BUi9lbMMWwoJ7FTmCexEJBhB4GvVsFFIvKkecWwx0-56lMKlHI0wUaApzqEALw_wcB) informing public the effect and basic knowledge about the vaccine. However, there are still groups of people who doesn't take the vaccine due to many different reasons such as religion, personal beliefs, economic difficulties or hardship of getting access to the vaccine. 

Through analyzing extracted dataset, it is the hope of this investigation to find certain populations that are least likely to take the vaccine and propose potential future works to find out what caused the observed pattern. To better understand the process, analysts looked at [a paper published on CDC official website](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm?fbclid=IwAR0V9HbHoK8TZNZd5PptJoahzzS2qpwVCGAztIvAZzNNdPLweSaPWCYPnGU) to gain valuable insights.It is mentioned in this work that the least vaccined group keeps changing as time pass by. suggesting that timeliness is something that should be considered in later discussion.

[The COVID website](https://covid19.ca.gov/) created by the government of California is also a big inspiration in the creation process of this website, as builders designed part of the planning of this website while referring to it.
