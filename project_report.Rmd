### Introduction
#### Motivation
With the spread of COVID-19 enters its third year, the human society seem to have accepted its existence and accepted it as part of our daily lives. However, that doesn't mean COVID has stopped its harm on the public. with the huge amount of studies on COVID-19 in multiple different disciplines of studies, researchers and scholars have understand its influence more than ever, and agreed on the fact that COVID has disproportionately harmed certain groups of people more than others due to [race, economic, or social status.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1851382)

With interest in investigating more on factors that can influence people's chances of getting the disease, the builders of this website decided to look specifically into one state of America: California. California is chosen due to its large geographic area, relatively large population size, and relatively modern infrastructures. It is likely that California's picture during the pandemic can be interpreted as a reference to other regions with high population across the world. Since COVID-19 is a highly transmissible disease to start with, this is ideal knowledge that analysts want to gain insight on.

#### Related Work
As stated in motivation, there are many published works focused on COVID since its first outbreak. To gain as much insight on the Initial questions as possible, the analysts mainly looked at literature related to COVID spreading in the region of California. 

[A particular paper](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598) was very valuable to this investigation as it analyzed more than a thousand cases of COVID-19 patients in California during a time period that overlaps partly with our time period of investigation interest.It used multivariable logistic regression to assess the risk of hospitalization for the patients, which is also a regression method that this investigation intend to use. Thus, it was a very good reference literature.

Since part of the data set that this study is based on are focused on different age groups and their chance of hospitalization and infection of COVID-19. One of the key factors that analysts are interested in is age.
To understand this particular sector better, [this piece of literature](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abe8372) provided lots of information on the "source age group" of resurgence of cases during the pandemic, and offered insights on potential confonders that needs to be mentioned and discussed in this investigation. 

Apart from populations that gets the disease, it is also necessary to discuss the most popular measure for public to avoid getting the disease in the first place: vaccination. There are lots of published papers, articles, and [websites](https://www.gavi.org/covid19-vaccines?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkMGcBhCSARIsAIW6d0BUi9lbMMWwoJ7FTmCexEJBhB4GvVsFFIvKkecWwx0-56lMKlHI0wUaApzqEALw_wcB) informing public the effect and basic knowledge about the vaccine. However, there are still groups of people who doesn't take the vaccine due to many different reasons such as religion, personal beliefs, economic difficulties or hardship of getting access to the vaccine. 

Through analyzing extracted dataset, it is the hope of this investigation to find certain populations that are least likely to take the vaccine and propose potential future works to find out what caused the observed pattern. To better understand the process, analysts looked at [a paper published on CDC official website](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm?fbclid=IwAR0V9HbHoK8TZNZd5PptJoahzzS2qpwVCGAztIvAZzNNdPLweSaPWCYPnGU) to gain valuable insights.It is mentioned in this work that the least vaccined group keeps changing as time pass by. suggesting that timeliness is something that should be considered in later discussion.

[The COVID website](https://covid19.ca.gov/) created by the government of California is also a big inspiration in the creation process of this website, as builders designed part of the planning of this website while referring to it.

#### Initial questions
Our initial questions is how does different factors(e.g. Race, Age, Demographic factor, gender) influence on the hospitalization and disease odds for an individual or social group in the state of California. Particularly, does different sex groups have difference in their vaccination rate? In what parts of California tend to have the highest prevalence of the disease? How does the hospitalization rate differs among each racial group? Are teenagers being considered as a vulnerable group towards the virus, judging based on the data set we have? 

### Data Source

#### CHHS
A major part of the data used in this investigation originally came from [California Health and Human Service Open Data Portal](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/organization/california-department-of-public-health). This is a website with numerous databases, directly held by the agency of California health and human services, abbreviated as CHHS. California health and human service is the state agency tasked with administration and oversight of "state and federal programs for health care, social services, public assistance and rehabilitation" in the U.S. state of California. The agency is headed by the Secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, with headquarters in Sacramento. Many of the laws in the California Health and Safety Codes are enforced by it. 

This data portal includes data related to public health activities across the state of California. Most of which is collected at the county level but there are also data sets that contains data at individual level.

The three specific datasets that will be used for this investigation later is listed below, extracted from the site by simply downloading them into the R project:

[First data set](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-time-series-metrics-by-county-and-state) : This data set focuses at information such as demographic category, total cases, case percentage, death, and report date related to COVID-19 in different counties of the state of California.

[Second data set](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-post-vaccination-infection-data) : This data set focuses on the COVID-19 disease information on vaccination status, including variables such as vaccinated cases vs. unvaccinated cases, vaccinated death vs. unvaccinated death.

[Third data set](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-hospital-data): This data set is focused on the hospitalization by county in California. Besides recording the amount of people that are hospitalized, it offers comparison between the hospitalized COVID confirmed patients, and ICU suspected covid patients in the region. 

#### Opendatasoft

In order to present an interactive map to users that contains population infected by time in different counties, analysts referred to geographic coordination data online for each county. 

Opendatasoft is a French company that offers data sharing software. Based in Paris, it also has a subsidiary in Boston (United States) and an office in Nantes(France).
Opendatasoft has developed a tool for sharing and reusing the data of companies and public administrations. Its software lets people organize, share, and visualize any type of data. The software can be used by both private companies and public entities. The [geographic data set](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-county-boundaries/table/?disjunctive.statefp&disjunctive.countyfp&disjunctive.name&disjunctive.namelsad&disjunctive.stusab&disjunctive.state_name&sort=stusab&refine.stusab=CA) this investigation is interested in from Opendatasoft is information about US County Boundaries.  

#### USA.com
This is a website contains data about states, metro areas, counties, cities, zip codes, and area codes information, including population, races, income, housing, etc. In this investigation, data extracted from this website is about county areas in California through [this link](http://www.usa.com/rank/california-state--land-area--county-rank.htm).

#### Employment Development Department
Since 1935, the Employment Development Department(EDD) had been connecting with job seekers and employers in an effort to build the economy of Golden State. Mean while it has been collecting data related to employment each month by industry data for California and sub-state areas. One of its data set is [current industry employment and unemployment rates for counties](https://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/industry-employment-and-unemployment-rates-for-counties.html), which could produce insightful result through this investigation by connecting data like unemployment rate to the prevalence of disease or hospitalization rate.

### Exploratory Analysis
#### Outcomes by County

Start our exploration of the data set by focusing on two variables of interest: COVID `prevalence` and `death rate`. These two variables are being hypothesized to have correlation with other demographic variables such as age, gender, race, unemployment rate, etc.

##### Prevalence across county

```{r warning = F, message = F}
point <- format_format(big.mark = " ", decimal.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
    
demo_plot = demo %>%
    filter(!county_name %in% "Out of state") %>%
    group_by(county_name, population) %>% 
    summarize(total_cases = sum(reported_cases),
              total_deaths = sum(reported_deaths),
              prevalence = total_cases/mean(population)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(county_name = fct_reorder(county_name, prevalence)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = county_name, y = prevalence, color = county_name)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1) +
    theme(
      legend.position = "none"
    ) +
    labs(x = "County",
         y = "Prevalence",
         title = "Prevalence Across County") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = point)

ggplotly(demo_plot, width = 800, height = 500)
```

Until November 2022 (information given by data source), we can observe that the COVID prevalence ranges from as low as 0.094 to nearly 0.386  by county in California, suggesting a roughly 4.1x difference between the minimum and maximum. As a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed, the percentage of Americans who have been infected with COVID-19 is approximately 30% in November 2022. Taking the prevalence of 30% as the baseline for further comparisons, it is worth noticing that around 80% of counties in California have a moderate level of prevalence falling between around 16% to 29%, and around 10% of counties show a quite low prevalence below 15%. Only 6 out of 58 counties in California shows prevalence of above 30%. The COVID infection in California seems relatively controllable to a large extent compared to the general prevalence level across the United States. As for the prevalence differences, it may be caused by some other differentiable factors across counties, and we would like to further discuss about it in later parts.

##### Death Rate across County

```{r warning = F, message = F}
point <- format_format(big.mark = " ", decimal.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)

demo_plot_1 = demo %>%
    filter(!county_name %in% "Out of state") %>%
    group_by(county_name) %>% 
    summarize(total_cases = sum(reported_cases),
              total_deaths = sum(reported_deaths),
              death_rate = total_deaths / total_cases) %>% 
    mutate(county_name = fct_reorder(county_name, death_rate)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = county_name, y = death_rate, color = county_name)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1) +
    theme(
      legend.position = "none"
    ) +
    labs(x = "County",
         y = "Death Rate",
         title = "Death Rate Across County") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = point)

ggplotly(demo_plot_1, width = 800, height = 500)
```

We can observe that the death rates range from as low as 0.00% to 1.76% by county in California. The density graph suggests a quite centralized distribution of death rates across counties, that most countiesâ€™ death rates fall between 0.25% to 1.25%. As for the minimum value from this data set, there is so far no recorded death so as 0% death rate in Alpine. As for the maximum, Siskiyouâ€™s recorded death rate is 1.76% in November 2022, which is a little bit higher than the average country-wide death rate of 1.09% (data reported by [John Hopkins Universityâ€™s Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)). Considering the difference shown in death rates across counties, we will investigate the associations between this outcome variable and other potential factors in the following section.

#### 2. Worst & Best conuties for outcomes

##### Worst counties for each COVID outcome

Furthermore, we zoom in on the pandemic responses and extract the 10 worst COVID outcome results, i.e. highest prevalence and highest death rates, in corresponding counties, and plot them as bar charts for a more straightforward visualization.

```{r warning = F, message = F}
demo_worst_1 =

##### Best counties for each COVID outcome

Also, we extract the 10 best covid outcome results, i.e. lowest prevalence and lowest death rates, in corresponding counties.

```{r warning = F, message = F}
demo_best_1 =
    demo %>%

From the above tables and bar charts, Kings County responses to COVID with highest prevalence of 38.64%, and Siskiyou responses to covid with highest death rate of 1.76%. In comparison, Modoc has the lowest prevalence of 9.45% in California, and Alpine has no recorded death until November 2022. Upon observations, two out of ten counties with top prevalence, Imperial and Tuolumne, also have top death rates. And two out of ten counties with lowest prevalence, Alpine and Colusa, also have lowest death rates. While to be highlighted here, Siskiyou County has one of the lowest prevalence but the highest death rate among all counties. This preliminary observation indicates that it is hard to obtain an apparent relationship between the prevalence and death rates. Further steps are required to take in order to explore the associations and correlations between our two outcome variables, COVID prevalence and death rates.

##### Associations between outcomes across county

To find out the associations between two outcomes across counties, we decide to use bubble chart to visualize relationships between three numeric variables, death rates, prevalence proportion, and the population size for each county.

```{r warning = F, message = F}
 demo_asso =   
    demo %>% 
    filter(!county_name %in% "Out of state") %>%
    group_by(county_name, population) %>% 
    summarize(total_cases = sum(reported_cases),
              total_deaths = sum(reported_deaths),
              prevalence = total_cases/mean(population),
              death_rates = total_deaths/total_cases) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = prevalence, y = death_rates)) + 
	  geom_point(aes(color = county_name, size = population)) + 
	  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 0.4, aes(weight = population)) + 
	  labs(
	    x = "Prevalence",
	    y = "Death Rate",
	    size = "Population",
	    col = "County",
	    title = "Associations Between Outcomes Across County"
	  ) +
        theme(legend.title = element_text(size = 5),
          legend.key.size = unit(0.3, 'cm'),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 4)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
    theme(
          axis.title.x = element_text(size = 6),
          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5),
          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 6),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))

ggplotly(demo_asso, width = 800, height = 500)
```

As we plotted, the values for each bubble are encoded by its horizontal position on the x-axis of prevalence, its vertical position on the y-axis of death rates, and the size of the bubble depends on the population size. The color of each bubble represent different counties in California to provide a visual sense.  

On one hand, there is a positive best-fit trend line drawn on this plot which indicates a positive relationship between prevalence and death rates across counties, although this relationship is considerably weak. On the other hand, as the values on the horizontal and vertical scale decreases, we can only observe small bubbles on the bottom-left corners. And as the values on the horizontal or vertical scale increases, relatively large bubbles start to appear. To add on, the largest bubble of Los Angeles located on the top-right corner on this graph, indicating its relatively high prevalence and high death rate. These two perspective of findings may coincide with each other, suggesting a positive but weak relationship between outcomes across county.

Looking at the result figures of exploratory analysis above, we can observe many interesting things about our data set. To start with, For the Prevalence vs. Age graph, we can see that the age group 18-49 has the highest prevalence, followed by 50-64, followed by 0-17 and ends with the age group of 65+. For the graph of Prevalence vs. Gender, although female tend to have a higher prevalence according to the graph, the difference between the two gender is really not that large. When considering the graph of Prevalence vs. Race, we see that Latino people have significantly higher prevalence compared to other races. 

One of the most insightful graph we obtained is the graph of Death Rate vs. Age. In this graph we see that although the 65+ age group previously had relatively low disease prevalence, they still have significantly higher death rate compared to other age groups. This finding suggests that the elder citizens are especially vulnerable to COVID. For the graph of Death Rate vs. Gender, we find males to have higher death rate than female. Lastly, for the graph of Death Rate vs. Race, it followed the pattern we previously observed in the Prevalence vs. Race graph, which is reasonable.


### Inference Analysis: Regression
#### Multiple linear Regression for prevalence

For model building purpose of this investigation, a multiple linear regression model is considered to investigate on hospitalization rate. The underlying logic for this model is relatively simple, analysts extract data that includes disease prevalence, area, population, location and tests. The hypothetical multiple linear regression function for this particular inference analysis is shown as below:

$$\widehat{Prevalence}=-69.049+9.251 \cdot ln(unemployment)+1.495 \cdot ln(area)+0.642 \cdot ln(population)+9.389 \cdot ln(test)$$

In the above equation, disease prevalence is the desired outcome while the amount of tests, unemployment, area, location, and population are predictors. B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5 are the factors for each predictors respectively. Under ideal circumstances, we would expect our model to be able to predict the death counts in a region, given its number of tests, population, and unemployment rate. 

It is necessary to mention that in the original dataset on which this model looked at, analysts observed strong correlation within the some other data variables such as `vaccination` and `labor_rate`. After some data exploratory works, some right-skewness is noticed so analysts decided to apply natural logarithms to each continuous variables.

Another thing to look at was the correlation between the predictors to avoid the potential effect of multicollinearity, which is a statistical concept that describes the incidence of  several independent variables in a model are in fact correlated within themselves. This correlation test is later combined with criterion based model selection to select which predictors to put in for the final model.

The three criterion based model selection method are Cp criterion, adjusted R squared criterion, and LASSO. The results of these model selection method all gave similar predictor size, so in the end the analysts chose four predictors to construct the final model as shown in the equation above. After the construction of this model, a corss validation process is performed to further assess the prediction ability of this model.

### Statistical test

The Statistical test used in this investigation is Analysis of Variance(ANOVA), which is used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between categorical groups. After checking that there are no relationship between the subjects, groups of interest have equal sample size, dependent variable is normally distributed, population variances are equal, the ANOVA test can be conducted to our linear regression together with an F-test to determine whether the variable fits the data as well as the model. 

In total, two ANOVA tests are performed, one on the MLR model for disease Prevalence and one on the MLR model for death cases.

### Discussion
#### Project Obstacle

One of the first obstacles this project met was related with data scraping and cleaning. It was the groups' intention to perform similar investigations about COVID, but on a much more broader scale such as across the whole country. The reason that analysts didn't follow this starting plan is because data sets from different parts of the country simply are organized quite differently. So it would take analysts a lot of time to do the necessary bindings to forge a complete data set to work on. Also it is questioned whether the equipment that analysts use can efficiently process such large amount of data in reasonable time during later analysis process.

After deciding to put our focus on the state of California, the next obstacle analysts met was related to data pre-processing. There were lots of data variables retrieved from the original database that aren't going to be used in this investigation and also certain variable columns need to be created using the `mutate` function. As team members excahnged a lot of ideas when discussing and planning on which specific data to throw out and which ones to keep, sometimes there were even data manipulations going "back and forth", the website building process didn't really start for quite a long time. 

Formulating the right regression model and choosing the right variables to draw graphs were challenges as well. Due to lots of multicolinearity in our original data set, analysts had to run multiple model selection to decide which variables to include in the final model. A larger issue was that some originally designed plotting turned out to be just not feasible due to errors from the data set, for example in some cases, the death rate of a county was 100%, which is clearly wrong. It was also a challenge overall to interpret correlations after the  model is built and summarization of the model given using code because most of the correlations aren't perfect, there could be confounders that we haven't considered in the model. 

#### Findings

This investigations finding started off from exploratory analysis, where we first looked at the prevalence across counties. Until November 2022, COVID prevalence in California ranges from 0.094 to 0.386, with the lowest being the county of Modoc and highest being the county of Kings. Majority of the regions had experienced a prevalence between 0.15 to 0.25.

Another parameter we looked at was the death rate across different counties. The county with the lowest death rate in California was Alpine, where the death rate was 0 while the county with the highest death rate was Siskiyou, at about 1.76%. The majority death rate across counties fall within the bound of 0.25% to 1.25%. 

We further looked at the correlation between prevalence and death rates. It is interesting for us to notice that the correlation between these two factors was very low, with a correlation factor of -0.086. Meaning that in general, the disease prevalence in a county doesn't affect the death rate in that county. This is quite counter intuitive as logically, higher disease prevalence means more pressure on the health care system of that county, which is likely to lead to higher death rate as patients not being able to get the medical attention they need.

One possible explanation that we would offer for observing this phenomenon is that places with high disease prevalence may also tend to be places with high population density and better medical system. Thus although the prevalence is high, those counties are still able to control their death rate.

To examine our guess, we decide to take population by county into consideration for a further test on the association between outcomes. The finding of this test shows a relatively weak, but positive relationship between prevalence and death rates. So we still conclude that prevalence and death rate are very weakly correlated. 

To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the categorical groups that we considered to put in for our prediction model. Two ANOVA tests were run, one focusing on the predictors for fatality and the other one focusing on prevalence. The ANOVA test for fatality shows that only the variable `vaccinated` isn't significant as a predictor. We consider this finding as suggesting that vaccination, although certainly can help prevent someone from getting COVID, can't affect an individual's chance of dying from COVID.

The ANOVA test for disease prevalence shows that location is the only predictor that is not significant, which is understandable as the location of a county shouldn't be linked to its ability on treating the COVID patients.

For the two MLR models constructed in our Inference Analysis session, we first claim the disease prevalence in each county is a linear combination of four predictor variables, we found unemployment, area of the county, population and amount of tests all positively associated with disease prevalence. 

For the second model, we claim death rate in each county is a linear combination of seven predictor variables. The death rate is positively correlated with whether the county being an inland county, vaccination situation, unemployment rate, area of the county, amount of tests while being negatively correlated with the proportion of labor forces in the population. 

#### Next Steps

After looking back on our investigation, we would suggested future research to try to understand more on the association between socioeconomic factors and COVID prevalence/death rate. According to our models, although vaccine definitely has its value in disease control, it doesn't seem to stand out among all the other variables such as unemployment and proportion of labor forces in the population. Researches should also be done to investigate on how to better protect the non-labor force population, which tends to be our elders in the society since our investigation suggests that lower labor proportion population has higher death rate from COVID.
